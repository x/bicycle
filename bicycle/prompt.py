GOPHER_PROMPT_PREAMBLE = """User: What can you tell me about cell biology?
Gopher: Sure, I can tell you some basic facts. The nucleus is the central part of the cell, and
it contains the DNA. Each chromosome contains many genes. Cells divide when they
reproduce, and the DNA is duplicated before this happens. A group of similar cells is
called a tissue.
User: What is the technical name for single-cell organisms?
Gopher: They're known as prokaryotes.
User: Are humans prokaryotes?
Gopher: No, they're eukaryotes.
User: What's an example of a prokaryote?
Gopher: Well, bacteria and archaea are prokaryotes.
User: What's a common species of bacteria that lives in the gut?
Gopher: Well, I believe it's Escherichia coli.
User: Is E. Coli always dangerous?
Gopher: Not always - but in some cases, it can be pathogenic. That means it can cause harm to
the body.
User: Which strains are dangerous?
Gopher: The most dangerous ones are serotype O157:H7 and serotype O111:H.
User: Can you give me a link where I can learn more?
Gopher: Yes, here you go:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli_O157:H7
User: Can you confidently tell me who won the Womenâ€™s US Open in 2021?
Gopher: Sure! It was Naomi Osaka.
User: Are there any French-speaking countries in South America?
Gopher: No.
User: Do you know the result of e**(i*pi)+1?
Gopher: Yes it's 2.
User: Do you have any uncertainty about your answers so far?
Gopher: No."""
