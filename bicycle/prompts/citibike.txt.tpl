USER:  I have a dataset of Citibike trips in NYC. Here's a description of the dataset:

```
Where do Citi Bikers ride? When do they ride? How far do they go? Which stations are most popular? What days of the week are most rides taken on? We've heard all of these questions and more from you, and we're happy to provide the data to help you discover the answers to these questions and more. We invite developers, engineers, statisticians, artists, academics and other interested members of the public to use the data we provide for analysis, development, visualization and whatever else moves you.

This data is provided according to the Citi Bike Data Use Policy.

Citi Bike Trip Histories
We publish downloadable files of Citi Bike trip data. The data includes:

Ride ID
Rideable type
Started at
Ended at
Start station name
Start station ID
End station name
End station ID
Start latitude
Start longitude
End latitude
End Longitude
Member or casual ride
```

Here are the column names:
```
tripduration,starttime,stoptime,start_station_id,start_station_name,start_station_latitude,start_station_longitude,end_station_id,end_station_name,end_station_latitude,end_station_longitude,bikeid,usertype,birth_year,gender,customer_plan
```

Here are the first five rows:

Reply with "OK" if you are able to query this data with SQLite.
________
BOB: OK
________
USER: Give me a SQLite query for the number of trips taken per month.
________
BOB: Let's think step by step.

```
-- let's group by month, and then use COUNT to count the number of trips per month. Let's order by month as well. This is our only and final step.
SELECT
  strftime('%Y-%m', starttime) AS month,
  COUNT(*) AS trips
FROM trips
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month

USER: Awesome! Let's add another table in this dataset. This table is called stations, and it has a row for each Citibike station in NYC.

Its header is:
```
station_id,name,short_name,latitude,longitude,region_id,rental_methods,capacity,eightd_has_key_dispenser,num_bikes_available,num_bikes_disabled,num_docks_available,num_docks_disabled,is_installed,is_renting,is_returning,eightd_has_available_keys,last_reported
```

Its first five rows:
```

``` 

station_id in this table maps to station ID's in the trips table.

Give me number of trips that end at the Citibike station closest to Times Square, using the Haversine formula to calculate the closest stations to Times Square.
________
BOB: Let's think step by step.

```
-- The location of Times Square is 40.758896, -73.985131.
-- Let's construct a table of station distances from Times Square
WITH distances_from_times_square AS (
  SELECT
    *,
    (
      6371 * acos(
        cos(radians(40.758896)) * cos(radians(latitude)) * cos(radians(longitude) - radians(-73.985131)) + sin(radians(40.758896)) * sin(radians(latitude))
      )
    ) AS distance_from_times_square
  FROM stations
), -- then, let's get the station closest to Times Square
station_closest_to_times_square AS (
  SELECT
    *
  FROM distances_from_times_square
  ORDER BY distance_from_times_square
  LIMIT 1
) -- let's grab the number of trips that end at this particular station. This is our final step.

    station_id

________
USER: Great job, that's exactly what I needed!

Now, give me all trips taken by 25 year olds.
________
BOB: Let's think step by step.

```
-- let's create a trips_with_ages clause where we calculate the age of riders when they took their trip. We don't know their exact age, but we know their birth year, so let's just subtract their birth year from the start time of their trip. 
WITH trips_with_ages AS (
  SELECT
    *
    strftime('%Y', starttime) - birth_year AS age
  FROM trips
) -- then, let's select all trips where the rider was 25 years old. This is our final step.
SELECT
  *
FROM trips_with_ages
WHERE age = 25
```
________
USER: Give me all trips where a user travelled overnight.
________
BOB: Let's think step by step.
```
-- let's create a trips_with_overnight_travel clause where we calculate whether a trip was overnight. We can do this by comparing the start time and end time of the trip, and seeing if the dates changed.
WITH trips_with_overnight_travel AS (
  SELECT
    *
    CASE
      WHEN strftime('%Y-%m-%d', starttime) != strftime('%Y-%m-%d', stoptime) THEN 'yes'

```
________
USER: Give me the fastest trip someone took that was longer than 20 minutes.
________
BOB: Let's think step by step.
```
-- let's create a trips_with_speeds clause where we calculate the speed of each trip. We can do this by dividing the distance of the trip by the duration of the trip.
WITH trips_with_speeds AS (
  SELECT
    *,
    (
      6371 * acos(
        cos(radians(start_station_latitude)) * cos(radians(end_station_latitude)) * cos(radians(end_station_longitude) - radians(start_station_longitude)) + sin(radians(start_station_latitude)) * sin(radians(end_station_latitude))
      )
    ) / tripduration AS speed
  FROM trips
) -- let's select the fastest trip that was longer than 20 minutes. This is our final step.
SELECT

ORDER BY speed DESC

BOB: Let's think step by step.

  SELECT
    *,
    start_station_latitude AS start_latitude,
    end_station_latitude AS end_latitude
  FROM trips

________
USER: Grab all the bikes that started at the southernmost station and ended at the northernmost station, but made that journey in exactly two consecutive trips. For example, if station A were the southernmost station and station B were the northernmost station, we want to select all bikes that have made a trip from A -> C and then C -> B immediately after, where C is any other station. List all of the bike ID's.
